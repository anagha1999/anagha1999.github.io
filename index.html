                    <body> Student at UC Berkeley (batch of 2026) and dedicated problem solver with 3 years of experience at Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Edge. I possess a diverse skillset spanning cloud computing, distributed systems, front-end development, security, and machine learning, enabling me to tackle complex challenges in any environment.

                    At Microsoft, I focused on designing and implementing secure systems at scale, prioritizing both performance and reliability. I’ve contributed to the development of microservices handing millions of requests per minute while maintaining strict security protocols, ensuring data integrity and user trust.
                    
                    I thrive in agile settings, where I can lead initiatives from conception through deployment. My experience encompasses every aspect of the Agile Development Lifecycle, including test-driven development and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), allowing me to deliver robust and scalable systems.
                    
                    I am passionate about leveraging my technical skills in a product team to empower customers and drive impactful solutions that prioritize security, reliability and performance.
